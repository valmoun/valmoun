## About Me

I'm Valentin, an engineering trainee at SUEZ Consulting where I work on hydraulic modeling and data analysis. I'm pursuing a dual degree in Civil Engineering (INSA Rennes) and Governance with a focus on maritime affairs (Sciences Po Rennes).

My professional journey includes experience at Egis Water & Maritime analyzing coastal governance in West Africa and environmental project management with Good Karma Projects in Spain. I'm passionate about coastal resilience and developing sustainable solutions for environmental challenges.

## Skills & Experience

💻 I'm a self-taught programmer who started with Arduino and Scratch before advancing to Python, Java, and SQL. My technical skills include data analysis, GIS (QGIS), and hydraulic modeling, which I've applied in both academic and professional settings.

🌐 I'm fluent in French (native), English (C2), and Spanish (C1), having studied abroad in Uruguay and worked in Spain.

## Interests

When not coding or studying, you'll find me enjoying water sports (sailing, surfing), climbing rocks, or playing music. I've served as co-president of the university sailing club and have volunteered for various educational and environmental initiatives.
